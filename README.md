### 1. Web Layer (Controller)
- Contains REST API controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Example files:
  - `EmployeeController.java` – Handles Employee-related APIs.
  - `DepartmentController.java` – Handles Department-related APIs.

### 2. Service Layer (Business Logic)
- Contains the business logic of the application and interacts with the repositories to perform CRUD operations.
- Example files:
  - `EmployeeService.java` – Manages employee-related logic.
  - `DepartmentService.java` – Manages department-related logic.

### 3. Data Access Layer (Repository)
- Interfaces with the database to perform CRUD operations on entities.
- Example files:
  - `EmployeeRepository.java` – Repository for Employee entity.
  - `DepartmentRepository.java` – Repository for Department entity.

### 4. Domain Layer (Model)
- Defines the entities (models) that represent database tables.
- Example files:
  - `Employee.java` – Entity representing an Employee.
  - `Department.java` – Entity representing a Department.

### 5. DTO Layer (Data Transfer Object)
- DTOs are used to transfer data between the web layer (controller) and the service layer.
- Example files:
  - `EmployeeDTO.java` – DTO for Employee data.
  - `DepartmentDTO.java` – DTO for Department data.

### 6. Exception Handling
- Custom exceptions to handle application-specific errors.
- Example:
  - `ResourceNotFoundException.java` – Custom exception for handling 404 errors.

### 7. Configuration Layer
- Contains configuration classes like database settings, security configurations, and CORS settings.
- Example:
  - `WebConfig.java` – Web configurations and CORS settings.
